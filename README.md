# javascript-examples
A simple JavaScript code that checks all numbers from 1-100 and
Prints "Fizz" when the number is only divisible by 3, 
Prints "Buzz" when the number is only divisible by 5, 
Prints "FizzBuzz" when the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, 
Prints the number as it is in all other cases

Open the index.html file with any text edito and insert the right location of the FizzBuzz.js file in <script src=" ">.
After that open the index.html file with any browser and press the F12 key (in most browsers) to view the output in the Console.
